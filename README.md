# EconomicsLibrary

A very basic Modelica library of economic models I created as part of a paper
I wrote for the Modelica 2019 Conference.

Full disclosure: I don't know very much about economics or modeling of supply and demand.
But I had played around with using `flow` variables for modeling the flow of goods in 
a market and I wanted to write up the approach so others could build on it.
